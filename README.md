 ## Introduction
- An internal security audit was conducted on a fictional toy company called Botium Toys as part of the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](#https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate).
This project aimed to assess the organization‚Äôs existing security controls, identify critical vulnerabilities, and determine whether its security framework aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The audit process included the use of risk matrix tools and adherence to OWASP security principles to evaluate and prioritize risks effectively. The audit concludes with a set of actionable recommendations and a formal report intended for organizational stakeholders, aimed at improving the company‚Äôs overall security posture.

 ## Backdrop
 
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy‚Äôs online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company‚Äôs infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   
The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.
